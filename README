Usage:

./demRender -p DIRECTORY_NAME -z FLOAT -d POSITIVE_INT

-z defines the zscale for the elevation data. Usually this will be .001

-d defined the detail level. 1 is the highest detail and looks the best, but can be hard on the GPU
   setting this higher than 20 will lose the geometry of the landscape.
   5 is usually pretty good, but 1 really does look the best.

-p defines where within the resourses directory to look for the land information.
   right now the only data I am submitting is for Yosemite NP (YOSEMITE_HD) and Mt Rainier NP. (RAINIER_LARGE)

Reccomended runs:

./demRender -p YOSEMITE_HD -d 5 -z .001
./demRender -p RAINIER_LARGE -d 5 -z .001

INPUT:

by default the mouse is captured when you mouse over. to release the mouse, left click. To regrab the mouse, left click again.
   Note, that if you aren't expecting it to grab the mouse the view could fly all over the place as you search for your mouse... if this happens just click.

WASD - movement as expected
Space - unlock your y axis from the ground plane. (allow use of E and Q)
EQ - Move up(E) and down(q) along the y axis.

B/N - change the size of the entire scene. N to increase, B to decrease
R - reset to original view and size.
M - change the ground material... fun to see how the light changes as you move around
Z - turn on wireframe
X - turn off wireframe
