The default is to show yosemite with dancing trees, but I also included 
a Mt Rainier topo image that you can try if you want. Do note that as of 
right now the trees are relative to yosemite locations and will appead 
underneath Mt Rainier. I plan to make all of this dynamic for the final
project.

To view the rainier topo run 'cp rainier.jpg topo.jpg' in the resources 
folder.
